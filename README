What is Mockey?
===================

A testing tool, used to mock end point web services for the purpose of testing web service client applications. 

Features
====================

 * Use Mockey as a proxy to a real service, to inspect request and response messages
 * Set up Mockey to go through a corporate proxy server, to reach an endpoint web service
 * Support for HTTP/s interactions (even if your corporate proxy server has https as an endpoint web service)
 * Ability to 'play back' conversations for when endpoint services are not available
 * Ability to run EVERYTHING in a sandbox - your application and the endpoint webservices your application is consuming. 

What is Mockey not good at?
====================

 * Large payloads used in conversations, e.g. 10MB per message
 * Transport protocols other than HTTP, e.g. FTP. 
 * Complicated conversations e.g. if X, then call this database, else if Y, call 'rake FOO', else kick-off-Maven. 
 * Solving everything

Getting Started - Quick
====================

 * run "ant dist"
 * cd dist
 * java -jar Mockey.jar -t false 

This will start mockey, fire up your browser pointing at the defaults (port 8080, /home)
 
 * java -jar Mockey.jar --help

Will show you the options and their defaults.
